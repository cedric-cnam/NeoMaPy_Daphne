# Inference rules

Cypher queries corresponding to **knowledged rule** that produces new TF linking related Concepts and TF.

## R1
Match: pattern of the rule to find. Provides different instances
WHERE: "is null" allows to apply the rule only on *true* TF (not negative is "*not = true*"
UNWIND: gather values to aggregate them (time intervals / weights)
WITH: provides the output of the previous clauses in the following (TF + intervals + weights)
MERGE: create the head of the rule + new TF + the body with links to matched pattern
```
MATCH (c1:Concept{ID:"Person"})<-[:head]-(t1:TF) -[:body]-> (x:Concept),
  (c2:Concept{ID:"LivePeriod"}) <-[:head]- (t2:TF) -[:body]-> (x), (c3:Concept{ID:"MiddleAges"}) <-[:body]- (t2),
  (c4:Concept{ID:"Studied"}) <-[:head]- (t3:TF) -[:body]-> (x), (c5:Concept{ID:"CollegeOfNavarre"}) <-[:body]- (t3)
WHERE t1.not is null AND t2.not is null AND t3.not is null
UNWIND [t1.time[0], t2.time[0], t3.time[0]] as t_min
UNWIND [t1.time[1], t2.time[1], t3.time[1]] as t_max
UNWIND [t1.weight, t2.weight, t3.weight] as w_min
WITH x, t1, t2, t3, min(t_min) as t_min, max(t_max) as t_max, min(w_min) as w_min
MERGE (pf:Concept{ID:"PeasantFamily"})
MERGE (pf) <-[:head]- (R1:TF{ID:"R1_"+x.ID+"_P"+t1.ID+"_LP"+t2.ID+"_S"+t3.ID}) -[:body]-> (x)
MERGE (R1) -[:body]-> (t1)
MERGE (R1) -[:body]-> (t2)
MERGE (R1) -[:body]-> (t3)
  ON CREATE SET R1.time=[t_min, t_max], R1.weight=w_min, R1.rule=true

## Disjonctive query
With several types of concepts ID (Studied OR Worked)
And a negative constraint (Renaissance)
```
MATCH (c1:Concept{ID:"Person"})<-[:head]-(t1:TF) -[:body]-> (x:Concept),
  (c2:Concept{ID:"LivePeriod"}) <-[:head]- (t2:TF) -[:body]-> (x), (c3:Concept{ID:"MiddleAges"}) <-[:head]- (t2:TF) -[:body]-> (x),
  (c4:Concept) <-[:head]- (t3:TF) -[:body]-> (x), (t3) -[:body]-> (c5:Concept{ID:"CollegeOfNavarre"})
WHERE NOT (:Concept{ID:"Renaissance"}) <-- (:TF) --> (x)
  AND t1.not is null AND t2.not is null and t3.not is null
  AND C4.ID IN ["Studied", "Worked"]
UNWIND [t1.time[0], t2.time[0], t3.time[0]] as t_min
UNWIND [t1.time[1], t2.time[1], t3.time[1]] as t_max
UNWIND [t1.weight, t2.weight, t3.weight] as w_min
WITH t1, t2, t3, min(t_min) as t_min, max(t_max) as t_max, min(w_min) as w_min
MERGE (pf:Concept{ID:"PeasantFamily"})
MERGE (pf) <-[:head]- (R1:TF{ID:"R1_"+x.ID+"_P"+t1.ID+"_LP"+t2.ID+"_S"+t3.ID}) -[:body]-> (x), (R1) -[:body]-> (t1), (R1) -[:body]-> (t2), (R1) -[:body]-> (t3)
  ON CREATE SET R1.time=[t_min, t_max], R1.weight=w_min
```
